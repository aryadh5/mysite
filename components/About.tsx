          I'm a full stack software engineer working full-time for CarMax in Richmond, Virginia. I
          pride myself in writting clean code to solve technology and bussiness problems. In 2014, I
          began creating Minecraft Plugins and shortly after I fell in love with programming and
          decided to make it my career. I love to learn new things: I spend a lot of my free time
          reading, listening to talks and podcasts and working on side projects.
